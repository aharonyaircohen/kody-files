# Shared File Manager

## What this feature does

The File Manager is the reusable core of this standalone app. Callers supply a transport, route base, root path, upload policy, filters, and optional operations. The included app uses the GitHub transport.

## When to use it

Use it for a tree-based file workspace. Provider-specific paths, persistence, and policy belong in the caller's adapter, not inside the shared manager.

## Available actions and options

- Lazy directory browsing, breadcrumbs, refresh, responsive split-pane navigation, and full-text search when the transport supports it.
- Read source and metadata; render Markdown, text/code, HTML, images, PDF, audio, video, and supported advanced document previews.
- Toggle preview/source, copy content or path, and compare commit history when supported.
- Edit text with Monaco, track unsaved changes, undo, and save with keyboard shortcuts.
- Create files/folders, upload one or many files, rename/move, copy, and delete only when the active transport supplies those optional operations.
- Restrict visible entries and uploads through caller-owned filters and upload policy.

## Requirements and permissions

- Every workspace needs a configured `FilesTransport` with required read operations.
- Write controls require matching optional transport methods and authenticated write permission.
- Uploads must satisfy the caller's extension policy and size limit; the default GitHub blob ceiling is 100 MB.
- Paths are resolved inside the caller-provided root and route base.
- HTML preview runs sandboxed with a restrictive Content Security Policy.

## What will not work

- The shared manager cannot invent a missing transport operation.
- Feature-specific rules must not be added to shared components or file operations.
- A read-only workspace cannot save, upload, move, copy, create, or delete.
- Markdown-only spaces reject other extensions.
- HTML previews cannot open frames, submit forms, load plugins, or escape the sandbox.
- Binary formats without a supported native or advanced renderer cannot be edited as text.

## Known limitations

- GitHub-backed operations are subject to GitHub size, rate, SHA-conflict, and permission limits.
- The included app sends uploads from the browser directly to GitHub to avoid the Vercel Function request limit; other operations use the same-origin API.
- Preview support varies by format and available renderer.
- Search and history are optional transport capabilities.
- Unsaved local edits are kept as drafts in this browser, but are not written to GitHub until a successful transport save.

## Common failures and recovery

- **Operation is missing:** the caller's transport is read-only or does not implement that action.
- **Upload rejected:** correct the extension or reduce the file below the active policy limit.
- **Write conflict:** refresh the file and reapply changes against the latest version.
- **Preview unavailable:** use source/download where supported or open the file in its authoritative system.
- **Path not found:** return to the configured root and refresh the tree.

## Related tools and capabilities

The File Manager is UI infrastructure, not an Agent Capability. Agents must use the feature-owned read/write tools for the active workspace and obey their permissions.
